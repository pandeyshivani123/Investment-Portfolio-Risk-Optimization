# Investment-Portfolio-Risk-Optimization
This project involved developing financial models and conducting comprehensive analyses to optimize investment portfolio allocation. Using advanced statistical techniques and tools, the project aimed to evaluate and minimize risk while ensuring maximum returns under varying market conditions. 

Key Objectives:
Develop and implement Monte Carlo simulations to predict portfolio performance across different market scenarios.
Perform variance analysis to evaluate risk-adjusted returns and guide optimal allocation strategies.
Minimize portfolio risks while maintaining desired return thresholds.


Tools and Technologies Used:
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Excel: Variance Analysis, Reporting
Monte Carlo Simulation: Probability modeling
Modern Portfolio Theory: Optimization framework
